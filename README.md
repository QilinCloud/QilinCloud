# Welcome!

Qilin.Cloud is a global plattform for composable commerce. We're driven by our mission to enable every merchat using the right tools at the right time!
Qilin.Cloud is part of the [MACH Alliance](https://machalliance.org/).

This space is a way for us to collaborate directly with developers like you.


## What we’re doing

We have built a technology framework where all areas of e-commerce are meet in such a way that a seamless & fast exchange is possible in all directions.
With our powerfull data orchestration engine, you are able to create customised processors for your very own, specific scenario. Accordingly to our sophisticated process mining engine, you not only define, overvies and analyze processes, but also automatically identify inefficiencies and therefore safe time and money to have them fixed.
We are constantly working on it and improving our services, adding new endpoints and methods, refining models and fixing bugs. All of this has to be well documented, because the goal of our work is to meet the needs of the Qilin.Cloud developer community and make your life easier. This space should therefore be for open, fast and uncomplicated exchange.


## Why we’re building in the open

We’ve spent a lot of time poring over data and charts, but we recognize that our users know their needs best. We also have a hunch that many of you share the same needs. By sharing our plans, documentation, and progress we can all work together to build the API that you need.
