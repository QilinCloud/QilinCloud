# Welcome!

Qilin is a global plattform for composable commerce. We're driven by our mission to enable every merchat using the right tools at the right time!
Qilin is part of the [MACH Alliance](https://machalliance.org/).

This space is a way for us to collaborate directly with developers like you.


## What we’re doing

We have built a foundation of which all areas of e-commerce are to be mapped in such a way that a seamless exchange is possible in all directions. We are constantly working on it and improving our services, adding new endpoints and methods, refining models and fixing bugs. All of this has to be well documented, because the goal of our work is to meet the needs of the Qilin developer community and make your life easier. This space should therefore be for open, fast and uncomplicated exchange.


## Why we’re building in the open

We’ve spent a lot of time poring over data and charts, but we recognize that our users know their needs best. We also have a hunch that many of you share the same needs. By sharing our plans, documentation, and progress we can all work together to build the API that you need.


## How to get started

We have created a new documentation site for the API, which can be found at [documentation.api.qilin.cloud](https://documentation.api.qilin.cloud/). We’ll continue to add new content. If you are looking for specific documentation or have feedback, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/QilinCloud/api/issues/new/choose).


### Useful links to get started

* [Making requests](https://documentation.api.qilin.cloud/)
* [API schema docs](https://documentation.api.qilin.cloud/)
* [Getting Developer Access](https://documentation.api.qilin.cloud/)


## How to provide feedback

We’ve built several [issue templates](https://github.com/QilinCloud/api/issues/new/choose) to make it easier for you. Generally, bugs and feature requests for the API or docs should be Github issues. Everything else should be sent as a support request to [development@qilin.cloud](mailto:development@qilin.cloud).

We also aimed to make it easy to provide feedback directly from our API reference docs. Each endpoint definition includes a link to file a bug or feature request with some details filled in.

Note that by submitting your feedback, we have the right to use it.

Legalese-wise, this means it’s considered non-confidential and non-proprietary to you, and you grant Qilin a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, sub-licensable, perpetual license to use and publish those ideas and materials for any purpose, without compensation to you.
