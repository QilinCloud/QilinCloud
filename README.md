# Welcome!

Qilin.Cloud is a global technology platform for [composable commerce](https://github.com/QilinCloud/QilinCloud/wiki/Composable-Commerce). We're driven by our mission to enable developers creating fabulous products for every participant of e-commerce around the globe!
Let's help them together, using the right tools at the right time!

Qilin.Cloud is part of the [MACH Alliance](https://github.com/QilinCloud/QilinCloud/wiki/MACH-Alliance).

This space is a way for us to collaborate directly with developers like you.


## What we’re doing

With Qilin.Cloud we've created a [technological platform](https://github.com/QilinCloud/QilinCloud/wiki/Technology-Platform)  where all aspects of e-commerce seamlessly converge, ensuring rapid and efficient interchangeability regardless of the who, when, how much, and where. We understand the challenges faced by software developers and decision-makers in businesses, and our platform is designed to empower you to create extraordinary products for your users with an unprecedented time-to-market range, without compromising on stability, quality, or scalability.

Our powerful data orchestration engine allows you to tailor custom processors for your specific scenarios. Additionally, our [process mining](https://github.com/QilinCloud/QilinCloud/wiki/Process-Mining) engine not only enables you to define, overview, and analyze processes but also automatically identifies inefficiencies, saving you valuable time and money in resolving them.

We are dedicated to continuous improvement, regularly adding new endpoints and methods, refining models, and addressing any bugs that may arise. Ensuring our services are well-documented is crucial to us, as our ultimate goal is to meet the needs of the Qilin.Cloud developer community and make your life easier. This space is intended to foster an open, fast, and uncomplicated exchange of ideas and solutions.

Join us on this journey to transform the e-commerce landscape and unlock the full potential of your business in a dynamic and efficient manner. Together, we'll redefine the possibilities and create extraordinary experiences for your users.

## Why we’re building in the open

We’ve spent a lot of time poring over data and charts, but we recognize that our users know their needs best. We also have a hunch that many of you share the same needs. By sharing our plans, documentation, and progress we can all work together to build the platform that you need. We strongly believe that building in the open, is more than just a phrase. We are advocats of [open commerce](https://github.com/QilinCloud/QilinCloud/wiki/Open-Commerce), from our point of view it's the future of e-commerce.
